## MCPI Texturepack utility v1.1
> This repo is a upload of the code which was originally made by `NikZapp#6774` on Discord with minor tweaks to work with MCPI-Reborn. Here is a formatted version of the original README from NikZapp:

Coded by NikZapp. This code is sadly not protected.

### Features:
1. Install custom textures witout navigating in all the folders.
2. Every texture is fully customisable.
3. All textures are stored in one file.
4. Easy to use.

### Will be added soon:
 + [x] HD Texture support!
 + [x] Autocompleting `gui_blocks.png` (how blocks look in your inventory)
 + [ ] More!

### How to use:
1. Execute the `addpack.py` file in the command line as root (using `sudo`, for example).
2. If you want to install a texturepack, input the path to it.
3. If you however want to remove all texturepacks, just press enter.

To create a texturepack, follow these steps:
1. Put all of your textures in one folder. There should be no subfolders, like this:
 + Not to do:
```
/path/to/your/pack/gui/gui2.png
/path/to/your/pack/terrain.png
/path/to/your/pack/mob/creeper.png
```
 + To do:
```
/path/to/your/pack/gui2.png
/path/to/your/pack/terrain.png
/path/to/your/pack/creeper.png
```

2. Compress the textures using the `.zip` format:
```
/path/to/your/pack.zip/gui2.png
/path/to/your/pack.zip/terrain.png
/path/to/your/pack.zip/creeper.png
```

Done!
