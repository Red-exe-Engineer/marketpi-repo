# MCPI-Repo Seeds
This is a list of Minecraft Pi seeds. Seeds are designated for Minecraft Pi Edition and Pocket Edition alpha v0.6.1. Register your MCPI seeds here; including what makes them useful and/or unique, and whether or not they are they useful for creative or survival.

## World Creation from Seed
 - **Method 1**: Use an Android device to use MCPE 0.6.1, to ensure your world is compatible with Pi. Create a world with a fixed seed using PE's create world pop-up. If you don't have PE 0.6.1, download the apk from [here](https://archive.org/download/MinecraftPE0.1.0/Minecraft%20PE%200.6.1.apk), and install it on an Android device.
 - **Method 2**: Use a MCPI Server software, such as [MCPI-Reborn](https://gitea.thebrokenrail.com/TheBrokenRail/minecraft-pi-reborn/src/branch/master/docs/DEDICATED_SERVER.md) to create a world from a specific seed and gamemode, you can specify this in the 'server.properties' file if you use MCPI-Reborn. Put the gamemode and seed into the `server.properties` before generating the world.

## Seed Retrieval from World
If you want to retrieve the seed from a pre-existing Pi/PE world, use a MCPE-compatible NBT level editing tool, such as [MCPIedit](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/MCPIedit). When you have launched MCPIedit, select your world's `level.dat` file, located in the corresponding world folder. If you are successful, you should be able to see the seed for your world in the MCPIedit window, next to the "Seed" label.
