~~~~~~~~~~Submitting a world~~~~~~~~~~
Your world must contain ONLY these files:
- level.dat

It MUST NOT CONTAIN THESE FILES OR DIRECTORIES
- level_old.dat
- players/
- <log files>
- <Any other file or directory>

All this must be wrapped into a directory inside the ZIP named as <worldnamewithoutspaces>_v<version>.zip. The directory can be any name you like, but it better relate to the world.

You MUST add a screenshot and add a JSON entry when you add a world.
